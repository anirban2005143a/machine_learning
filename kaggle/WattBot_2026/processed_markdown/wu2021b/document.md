### **ABSTRACT** 

Advancements in digital technologies have a bootstrapping effect. The past fifty years of technological innovations from the computer architecture community have brought innovations and orders-ofmagnitude efficiency improvements that engender use cases that were not previously possible – stimulating novel application domains and increasing uses and deployments at an ever-faster pace. Consequently, computing technologies have fueled significant economic growth, creating education opportunities, enabling access to a wider and more diverse spectrum of information, and, at the same time, connecting people of differing needs in the world together. Technology must be offered that is inclusive of the world’s physical, cultural, and economic diversity, and which is manufactured, used, and recycled with environmental sustainability at the forefront. For the next decades to come, we envision significant cross-disciplinary efforts to build a circular development cycle by placing pervasive connectivity, sustainability, and demographic inclusion at the design forefront in order to sustain and expand the benefits of a technologically rich society. We hope this work will inspire our computing community to take broader and more holistic approaches when developing technological solutions to serve people from different parts of the world.

## **Introduction** 

Digital technologies have had an undeniable influence on humanity’s well-being, transforming all aspects of our lives. Underpinned by advances in process technology, computer architecture, software engineering, and artificial intelligence (AI), the rapid technological development of the past five decades has altered the way we learn, work, commute, shop, socialize, eat, relax, and even sleep, both directly and indirectly. At the personal level, every US household has an average of 25 connected devices such as cell phones, tablets, laptops, gaming consoles, wireless headphones, smart TVs, smart speakers, fitness trackers, and connected fitness machines [Deloitte, 2021]. Digital technologies have also impacted major aspects of services that we regularly use and rely upon. Amazon warehouses are equipped with over 200,000 robots in 2020 to boost operational efficiency [Ackerman, 2021]. AI-powered robots are a growing presence in the farming industry [Sheikh, 2020]. Medicine has been transformed by technological advances leading to the decoding of the humane genome, resulting in genetically targeted therapies that help cancer patients survive longer or even enter full remission [Hum, 2021]. Looking ahead, AI is showing great promise in solving the grand challenge in biology – the protein structure prediction problem – which can once again lead to revolutionary changes in the field of biological sciences [Jumper et al., 2021]. 

Technology has also aided under-privileged and vulnerable groups in surprising ways. As an example, cell phones empower women in vulnerable situations to stay connected with the world, receive education and news, and establish businesses to support their families [Pathak, 2021]. Emerging technologies such as surveillance cameras enable authorities to respond to violence and curb crimes. Drones deliver life-saving medical supplies in rescues [Nyaaba and

Ayamga, 2021] and robots are employed in field discovery where the environment is unsafe for humans [Arnold et al., 2018]. The most recent example is the pandemic where digital technologies empowered society to stay connected and function effectively, and aided in disease tracking and drug discovery to limit the spread of the pandemic [Budd et al., 2020, Salathé et al., 2020, Facebook AI, 2020]. 

Advancements in digital technologies have a bootstrapping effect. The past fifty years of technological innovations from the computer architecture community have brought innovations and orders-of-magnitude efficiency improvements that engender use cases that were not previously possible – stimulating novel application domains and increasing uses and deployments at an ever-faster pace. Consequently, computing technologies have fueled significant economic growth, creating education opportunities, enabling access to a wider and more diverse spectrum of information, and connecting people of differing needs in the world together. 

## **Microprocessors at 50** 

Digital technologies have witnessed significant advancement over the past five decades. The first commercially-produced microprocessor – Intel 4004 – was manufactured in 10,000 nm process technology in 1971, and ran at 740kHZ with 2,250 transistors [Intel]. Fifty years later, the typical microprocessor is manufactured in a 5+ nm process technology and is capable of running at 5,000,000kHz (e.g., [Intel, 2019, AMD, 2020]) with more than 3.9 billion transistors. This is a more than 6,750 fold improvement in processor clock speed and 1.7 million times more transistors for microprocessors manufactured in 1971 than that in 2021. 

Moore’s law scaling underpins the evolution of microprocessors [Moore, 1965]. The steady doubling of transistor density enables miniaturization of computing systems, from large mainframes to personal computers and from mobile/smartphones to Internet of Things (IoTs) and AR/VR wearables. The _1990s_ were the golden age of microprocessor innovations. Microarchitectural optimizations enabled impressive ILP scaling: most notably, in-order vs. out-of-order execution [Tomasulo, 1967, Smith, 1982a, Hwu and Patt, 1986], branch predictors [Smith, 1981, Lee and Smith, 1984, Pnevmatikatos et al., 1993, Yeh et al., 1993, Jimenez and Lin, 2001], caches [Smith, 1982b, Hill, 1988, Przybylski et al., 1989, Jouppi, 1990], prefetchers [Baer and Chen, 1991, Fu et al., 1992, Falsafi and Wenisch, 2014], single vs. simultaneous multithreading [Tullsen et al., 1995, 1996, Nemirovsky and Tullsen, 2013]. 

![Figure](assets/figure_0001_page_0002.svg)In the _2000s_ , microprocessors faced two significant challenges: the _memory wall_ [Wulf and McKee, 1996] and the _power wall_ [Dennard et al., 1974, Bohr, 2007]. While processor frequencies improved with Moore’s law scaling, memory latency did not and memory subsystems increasingly gated performance. Furthermore, Dennard scaling came to an end and fine-grained, high power density thermal hot spots limited the performance of microprocessors. The Memory and Power walls subsequently drove decades of innovations in multi-core scaling [Olukotun et al., 2007], memory consistency and cache coherence [Adve and Gharachorloo, 1996, Hill, 1998, Sorin et al., 2011], cache and memory hierarchy optimization [Qureshi et al., 2007, Jaleel et al., 2010, Wu et al., 2011, Balasubramonian et al., 2011, Sardashti et al., 2015, Balasubramonian, 2019, Jain and Lin, 2019], network-on-chip design and optimization [Dally and Towles, 2001, Wang et al., 2002, Enright and Peh, 2009, Jerger et al., 2017], and power- and thermal-aware design and management [Brooks et al., 2000, Brooks and Martonosi, 2001, Skadron et al., 2003, Kaxiras and Martonosi, 2008, Själander et al., 2014]. 

During the same period, computations were migrating from client/personal devices to the cloud, demanding significant in- 

vestment in large-scale data centers [Barroso and Hölzle, 2009]. The location of these data centers is dictated by a myriad of constraints – maximizing power and operational efficiency, proximity to population centers, weather conditions, local tax breaks – leading to some interesting tradeoffs in size, location, and ownership (on premise or cloud based) of the data centers. In 2019, urban data centers that optimize for service latency responsiveness are 26.7% smaller in size than the average data center operated by the major cloud providers [Greenstein and Fang, 2020]. Furthermore, between traditional and highly optimized hyperscale data centers, power usage effectiveness (PUE) has a stark difference – more than 40% higher efficiency for hyperscale data centers (Figure 1). Going forward, the demand

on fast(er) service response and availability is playing an increasingly significant role on data center site selection and computing infrastructures connecting the edge and the cloud. 

The _2010s_ is the golden age of domain-specific architectures and specialized hardware, fueled by the rise of big data and AI [Esmaeilzadeh et al., 2011, Jouppi et al., 2018]. The massive economic growth opportunities of AI have revolutionized the entire system stack design, resulting in hardware tailored to machine learning execution [Ovtcharov et al., 2015, Chen et al., 2016, Jouppi et al., 2017, Fowers et al., 2018, Shao et al., 2019, Mattson et al., 2020, Henry et al., 2020, Reddi et al., 2021, Anderson et al., 2021, Jang et al., 2021, Thompto et al., 2021, NVIDIA]from megawatt data center-scale infrastructures, to tens of watts inference engines, to micro-watt microcontrollers at the edge. Building on top of domain-specific characteristics, further system efficiency can be extracted with a rich array of application-specific accelerators at the cloud scale [Taylor et al., 2020, Ranganathan et al., 2021]. 

The last fifty years of digital products have been driven by a combination of market innovation and user needs. In some cases, scientific curiosity, coupled with a market need for specialty medical drugs drove innovations such as the pursuit of the human genome. In other cases, innovations created a market such as the case for smartphones. The availability of smartphones led to further innovations and massive disruptions via _sharing economy_ companies such as Uber and AirBnB [Hamari et al., 2016]. None of this would have been feasible without fundamental innovation in process technology, hardware and software design, and a laser focus on efficiency (Figure 1), optimization (Figure 2), and cost reduction. Altogether, digital technology advancement has led to _efficiencies of scale_ propelling decades of economic growth. 

The narrow focus on marketability, efficiency, and disruptive innovation has also resulted in many challenging, and sometimes unexpected, societal issues. Examples include widening disparity and inequity of access to digital technologies, spread of disinformation and misinformation in online platforms, privacy and security violations at both the personal and political level, and propagation of human bias into AI training and use cases at-scale [Simons and Jones, 2012, Abelson et al., 2015, Gervais et al., 2016, Ahmed et al., 2017, Whittaker et al., 2018, Speicher et al., 2018, Chouldechova et al., 2018, Ekstrand et al., 2018, Selbst et al., 2019, Ali et al., 2019, Babaei et al., 2019, Crawford et al., 2019, Papakyriakopoulos et al., 2020, Park et al., 2021, Bender et al., 2021, Kleinberg and Raghavan, 2021]. In addition, the information and computing technology sectors consume a significant amount of global electricity, water, and natural resources, leading to paramount carbon and environmental footprint [Jain and Wullert, 2002, Strubell et al., 2019, Manne, 2020, Wu and Gupta, 2021, Gupta et al., 2021, Crawford et al., 

![Figure](assets/figure_0002_page_0003.svg)Figure 2: As a result of Moore’s law scaling and architectural optimization, GPU theoretical performance (GFLOPs) per watt doubles every 3-4 years [Sun et al., 2019]. 

2021]. Digital technology is an integral part of human existence. As the field matures and as the world faces dire challenges from climate change to societal and political upheavals, a deliberate approach is required to technological innovation that centers on a positive societal impact while serving the needs of a market economy. 

## **Looking to the Future** 

Predicting the future is always difficult. How many of us could have predicted that the technology depicted in futuristic TV shows from five decades ago such as Star Trek would be commonplace today (cell phones, AI, voice recognition to name a few)? However, what is possible to foretell are the following: 

- **Pervasive Connectivity** : the internet and the technology enabling it will become even more fundamental to everyday life, requiring that information and communication technology infrastructure, just like power grids, be both secure and resilient; 

- **Sustainability** : Environmental pollution, resource depletion and climate change will dominate how products are designed, produced, consumed, and recycled. Systems must be manufactured with less planetary impact, use less energy while in operation, and produce less e-waste at the end of life; and 

- **Demographic Inclusion** : Massive demographic upheavals resulting in an aging population in most of the world and rising population centers in Sub-Saharan Africa will influence what products are created and for whom, and where technology is designed and deployed in the future.

Socio-Technological Challenges and Opportunities: Paths Forward 

A PREPRINT 

**Pervasive Connectivity.** In 2021, approximately 65% of the world’s population has access to the internet [Lin, 2021], and this is expected to improve moving forward. Seamless connectivity will be required for everyday activities from ordering groceries to driving your car. There are advantages to connectivity from more efficient driving and less food waste, easy access to educational resources, and the ability to work remotely. However, what this also implies is that our lives and livelihoods will be inexorably linked to the accessibility, privacy, security, and resilience of the IT infrastructure. 

Reliable internet access for the world’s population is an essential requirement of pervasive connectivity. Despite the positive societal and economical impact, at-scale power delivery and networking infrastructure development has proven to be costly and highly geographically-constrained. According to an analysis from the FCC, at least 18 million Americans did not have stable broadband in 2020 [Wheeler, 2020], and many who have access may not be able to afford it. According to a recent UN report, two-thirds of school age children do not have access to the internet in their home [unicef, 2020]. Diverse technology innovations are particularly needed to increase information accessibility and to connect people of differing needs in the world together in a resilient manner. Microsoft Airband [Microsoft, a] aims to expand broadband access in rural parts of the United States while Google Loon [Loon] and Facebook Aquila [Wikipedia] provide affordable high-speed internet to under-connected communities by overcoming physical barriers with innovative technology solutions. The recent success of placing internet communication satellites in low Earth orbit opens the door to tremendous opportunities for providing internet access to populations in challenging geographic locations [Starlink]. While satellite communication removes the geographical and political boundaries, it can accelerate the spread of (mis)information. Thus, as technologies continue to enable pervasive connectivity at scale, we must take a deliberate approach to develop technology solutions responsibly. 

Along with pervasive connectivity comes the requirements for security and privacy given the prevalence of ransomware attacks and ongoing privacy hacks from both private groups and nation states. Many aspects of our public and private lives will be online and accessible to bad actors, and the internet and the technology it enables will continue to be susceptible without strong security and privacy measures in place from the top of the software stack to the underlying hardware running the code [Lipp et al., 2018, Kocher et al., 2019]. 

The IT infrastructure, just like in other critical infrastructure such as telecommunication and power delivery, will require backup and recovery mechanisms in order to minimize or eliminate downtime. These already exist in cloud data centers with examples such as redundant storage [Microsoft, 2021a] and network [Microsoft, 2021b], and backup batteries and generators. However, redundancy can require significant additional hardware and network bandwidth which inflates the cost of the overall cloud infrastructure. 

Recent climate events are pushing the issue of resiliency to the forefront. In the Texas power outages of 2021, many top-tier data centers were able to continue operations using diesel backup generators. However, there is a limit to how long backup systems can operate given the finite amount of fuel onsite and weather conditions making it difficult to transport more fuel to the data center [Sverdlik, 2021]. As catastrophic weather events become more common and last longer due to climate change, even the largest data centers may have trouble [Department of Energy, 2019]. For instance, the latest fires in Oregon brought down major power grid infrastructure that connects the grids of California to Oregon at the same time as a heat wave resulted in a need for additional power for cooling [Roth, 2021]. California narrowly escaped rolling blackouts this time, but these events will continue to increase in intensity and frequency as hot and dry conditions lengthen and strengthen the fire season, reduce hydro-electric power due to a lack of water, and increase the need for power for human comfort and survival. 

For IT infrastructures of the future, a one-size-fits-all solution may not work either for the type of data center or for the services that it provides. Large data centers that require many megawatts to operate may not be viable during a blackout with limited power and where critical operations such as hospitals are given priority. Smaller data centers may be more resilient either with backup generators or using a local micro-grid to run operations when the main grid is down. On the service side, some applications may be more tolerant of outages than others. Hence, with a limited power budget, application availability should be tiered during critical times. Other solutions include making applications resilient by design or more amenable to migration to a non-impacted data center given enough warning before catastrophic events occur [Hornsby, 2018, Google Cloud Architecture Center]. 

Designing for resilience addresses issues that are not just related to resilience under climate duress but also solutions that are tolerant of different geographies, power and networking infrastructures. In order to achieve pervasive connectivity across the world, IT infrastructure must be available across developed and developing regions. In Africa, for example, it is difficult and expensive to develop a power grid that can serve such a large continent. Renewables, however, have the benefit of being portable and scalable, and are powering much of Africa’s latest power advances, with off-grid and micro-grid renewable energy solutions serving poorer and/or non-centralized communities [The World Bank, 2020]. Data centers serving these regions may also have to rely on micro-grids running on renewable energy that fluctuate in their capacity based on the weather. Hence, rather than designing for a resilient and consistent power grid, IT

infrastructure may be better served by (co-)designing agile applications and data centers, such as [Íñigo Goiri et al., 2015, Radovanovic et al., 2021, Lin et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2021], that implicitly assume power fluctuations and variability. 

Achieving pervasive connectivity in the presence of resiliency, security, and privacy requirements can be challenging given the interrelated nature of the problems. For instance, current approaches to achieving resilient computing often rely on replication and redundancy which not only increases cost but also enlarges the surface of security and privacy preservation. Migrating applications to another region, which may be necessary due to power constraints, can expose data to further security threats. To retain physical security of data, applications may be hosted in limited geographical regions but this can increase application vulnerability to catastrophic events. In addition, secure and resilient computing infrastructures can often come with significant environmental implications. Hence, any computing infrastructure solutions must be cognizant of the multifaceted nature of the problems being addressed. 

**Sustainability.** Resource limitations, climate change, water depletion, electronic waste, ecosystem damage, and environmental racism are just a few of the topics under the larger sustainability umbrella. There is increased focus on these topics from both industrial and political institutions. All major technology companies have pledged to reduce or eliminate their carbon footprint in the next decade by reducing the environmental impact associated with manufacturing and using their products. Examples of such commitments are Facebook achieving NetZero in operational emissions in 2020 and across its value chain by 2030 [Facebook], Apple’s pledge for 100% carbon neutral supply chain by 2030 [Apple], Microsoft’s goal of being carbon negative by 2030 [Smith], and Google’s aim of 24x7 carbon free data centers [Google, b]. In 2020, Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft were the top four technology companies that purchased significant renewable energy capacities, accounting for 30% of the cumulative total from corporations globally [Schechner, 2021]. In addition, countries and trading zones are legislating carbon emission requirements. China has committed to be carbon free by 2060 [Myers, 2020] and the EU has committed to cut carbon emissions by 55% by 2030 [BBC, 2021]. 

Sustainability targets and the associated regulations will continue to increase, and hardware must be manufactured with less planetary impact, use less energy while in operation, and produce less e-waste at the end of life [Orcuttarchive, 2015, Chang et al., 2017]. Existing practices such as the move to hyperscale data centers have already reduced IT’s carbon footprint by consolidating and sharing computing resources, and operating those resources more efficiently (Figure 1) – AWS [Amazon, 2019], Azure [Microsoft, 2020], Google cloud [Evans and Gao, 2016], and Facebook datacenter infrastructures [Lee and Rowe, 2020]. In fact, data center electricity consumption has slowed down significantly. The total energy consumption of the US data centers increased by about 4% from 2010-2014, compared with the estimated 24% increase from 2005-10 and nearly 90% increase from 2000-05 [Masanet et al., 2020]. Furthermore, despite the increase in the global data center energy use, the number of users benefiting from the cloud infrastructure have increased even more—from 2010-18, the global data center compute instances increased by 5.5 times with an estimated 6% increase in the global data center energy use. 

However, more can be done – _we must go beyond efficiency optimization and build a sustainable ecosystem to achieve environmentally-sustainable computing_ . For instance, develop expandable hardware and software stack that facilitate significantly longer lifetimes than the current averages of less than 3 years for cell phones [Cordella et al., 2020] and 4 to 5 years for servers [Ascierto and Lawrence, 2020]. Modular system design will enable component-level upgrades without having to decommission the system at its entirety, reducing overall electronic waste and the environmental footprint [Fairphone]. Other actions being discussed or implemented require manufacturers to make their systems more repairable, resulting in increased product lifetime [Wiens and Gordon-Byrne, 2017, Alsever, 2021]. Another option is to reduce the number of devices in an average household. In the US, for example, the average household is equipped with an average of 25 connected devices [Deloitte, 2021]. In many cases, smartphones might be powerful enough for the task, but a tablet or laptop is needed for a viable keyboard or a larger viewing platform. Some of these additional devices could be replaced with a virtual reality or augmented reality solution that is both portable and can provide virtual keyboards and visual clarity without requiring additional hardware. To achieve an environmentally sustainable computing future, we will have to build a **circular economy** for computing that supports the design principle of _reduce_ , _reuse_ , _repair_ , and _recycle_ . These and other potential solutions likely require a complete redesign of the software and hardware stacks both at the edge, within the cloud, and in the edge-cloud collaborative execution environment, in order to provide resilient, long lasting, innovative solutions. 

Making technology more sustainable is only one part of the technical challenge. There is another side to the story—there are significant sustainability benefits resulting from computing technology. Programs, such as Farm Beats [Microsoft, 2015], address how to optimize operations on a farm using technology that is inexpensive and readily available to people in rural areas. Food production accounts for 19% of the world’s carbon emissions, and producing food more efficiently and with less toxicity has long term benefits for the world [Gates, 2021]. For the residential sector in the US, space heating and cooling contributed to over 40% of the total electricity consumption [U.S. Energy Information

Adminstration]. This is where smart home IoT devices, such as Nest, can have an impact. AI is used to discover new electrocatalysts for more efficient and scalable ways to store and use renewable energy [Zitnick et al., 2020] while also being used to predict renewable energy availability ahead of actual generation to better utilize the energy [Elkin and Witherspoon]. Another example is the current Covid outbreak. As horrendous as the outbreak has been and continues to be, technology has enabled a portion of the economy to continue to operate even as employees work remotely. In addition, the global carbon emissions for 2020 dropped by 6.4% with vehicle transportation in the US accounting for a portion of the global reduction [Tollefson, 2021]. Looking forward, information technology can improve efficiencies in practically every sector, from manufacturing to food production to transportation to controlling the climate in our homes and offices. Although there is a carbon cost associated with manufacturing and operating the IT ecosystem, this cost must be evaluated holistically [Chang et al., 2010, Bardon et al., 2020, Gupta et al., 2021, Patterson et al., 2021] in light of the benefits such an ecosystem can provide in other domains [Hager et al., 2019, Tomasev et al., 2020, Mulhern, 2021, United Nation, 2021]. 

**Demographic Inclusion.** Recent data has pointed to significant demographic changes that will be occurring by the year 2100 [Vollset et al., 2020]. These include a radically declining and/or aging population in Europe, North America and Asia, and an increasing population of younger workers in Sub-Saharan Africa. Figure 3 shows one population projection using data from the United Nations [Roser, 2019], indicating flattening or decreasing populations in most of the world except for Africa. The population decline is strongly correlated with an improved quality of life and educational achievement of women – much of which is being facilitated by technologically engendered developments such as portable devices and the internet – along with access to reproductive services. This trend holds regardless of the country, culture, or religion. These demographic changes will have a seismic impact on all societies, and will also dominate _what_ and _where_ technology is designed and deployed, respectively, in the future. 

For technology to be truly inclusive in a fully-connected world, it must be available and usable for _everyone_ – regardless of physical capabilities, geographic restrictions, or economic constraints. With the projected demographic changes, assistive technologies to address the needs of an aging population with physical restrictions will be essential for enhancing an individual’s ability to be a viable and contributing member of society. 

There is a rich history of intersection between assistive technology and everyday products. Word prediction was used as an assistive technology aid for individuals with physical or developmental difficulties before becoming more mainstream [Jacobs, 2015]. Close captioning helps the hearing impaired, but it is also used by people with average hearing to capture the conversation in a noisy environment or to help with accents in the dialogue. The reverse is also true – some of the most innovative technologies in the last few years are also inclusive of people with physical limitations. Smart speakers, such as Siri or Alexa, enable people with limited sight or physical mobility to communicate via verbal commands. Individuals with hearing issues can use their Apple AirPods as basic hearing aids [Haselton, 2019], and people with average hearing can use AI-enabled voice assistants to eliminate background noise and focus on the conversation at hand [Nachmani et al., 2020]. For the sight impaired, virtual reality glasses are improving the eyesight of patients with degenerative eye disease [Fearn, 2020]. 

![Figure](assets/figure_0003_page_0006.svg)Figure 3: Population growth estimation based on United Nations medium growth projections [Roser, 2019]. 

The virtual office technology and work culture developed during the Covid pandemic will continue to benefit individuals with physical limitations who may be unable to travel to work. Similarly, with the largest population of young workers residing in Africa over the next decades, innovative virtual office technology that can create seamless cohesion across geographies and cultures will be critical to economic success. Looking to the future, there is a clear demand for high-quality virtual reality experience in the first-person perspective. However, realizing smooth virtual space experience requires disruptive technology innovations – hardware architectures beyond Von Neumann, high pixel density displays [Ghosh et al., 2016, Kubota, 2020], near/in-sensor computing [Kodukula et al., 2021], flexible electronics [MacKenzie and Ho, 2015], or even brain-computer interface solutions [Brunner et al., 2011, Karageorgos et al., 2020]. 

Another requirement of inclusive technology, especially in light of projected demographic changes, is that it must operate across different geographic boundaries. In 2021, much of modern technology assumes some degree of development

and infrastructure, whether it be availability of the latest computing systems, broadband access, cell towers or power sources. However, much of the current world, including parts of developed countries, do not currently have unfettered access to these facilities. Even more daunting, approximately 770 million people, or about 1 out of 10 people in the world, do not have access to a stable supply of electricity [International Energy Agency]. 

In order to meet the upcoming needs of the world, technological growth and resources must focus on under-served areas. This includes developing data centers for regions that may not have a resilient power infrastructure or an infrastructure that is based on local renewable energy sources and does not tap into a regional grid. IT devices must be operable under adverse conditions where the local network and/or power may not be available 24/7 or varies based on external conditions [Isaacman and Martonosi, 2011, Hester et al., 2013, Lucia et al., 2017, Saleem et al., 2020]. For instance, devices need to operate for days without a recharge or must operate locally until wireless or broadband is available [Yetim and Martonosi, 2015] to ensure delay tolerance while maintaining user experiences. Energy storage technology plays a crucial role to smooth the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation but the cost must be significantly improved for practical deployment [Plumer, 2021]. And, for technology to be truly inclusive, the way AI technologies are developed and used must be human-centered, driven by the cultural and demographic differences in the population and with pro-social goals [Stray, 2021]. Furthermore, given its increasingly large impact on the society, AI must be developed with deliberation to construct fairer and more inclusive decisions and, at the same time, it must be adopted responsibly [Askell et al., 2019, NIST, 2021]. AI-powered products must be transparent with users on how data is gathered, used, and stored, and with controls to disable it [IBM, Microsoft, b, Google, c, Facebook, DOD]. 

Finally, any IT technology must be economically-accessible to most of the world’s population. Unfortunately, even the most basic form of computing devices, a cell phone, is prohibitively expensive for much of the world. According to the Alliance for Affordable Internet, nearly 2.5 billion people live in countries where a basic cell phone would cost nearly a quarter or more of the average monthly income [Roser, 2020]. Making the internet available to everyone will not solve the problem if the devices commonly used to access the internet are a luxury item for the world’s poor [Naseem et al., 2020]. In addition, many of the devices currently being used are inexpensive basic phones. Hence, solutions must be designed for “dumb” phones in order to reach the poorest communities. Even if users eventually have smartphones, data rates and lack of free wifi will limit the utility of data-heavy applications. Without reasonable device and application availability for the poorest communities, reaching the goal of pervasive connectivity will be difficult if not impossible and the digital divide will continue to widen between the rich and the poor. And, all technological solutions come with environmental impact that will inadvertently impact the marginalized communities the most. Thus, when developing technological solutions, we must keep in mind _why_ products are created and _for whom_ , and _where_ technology is designed and deployed, such that we consciously build environmentally-sustainable, socially-responsible, inclusive technologies for the next decades to come. 

## **Conclusion** 

Predicting the innovations of the future is a difficult if not impossible task. However, the political, societal, and environmental challenges the world faces are clear, and technology can play a significant role in helping societies adapt and thrive. The problems and solutions in the three domains of pervasive connectivity, sustainability, and inclusion are interconnected and must be addressed holistically. For instance, adapting the IT infrastructure to climate change must not in turn make climate change worse. Making innovative devices and software to address the needs of an aging population does not mean that poorer populations in other regions can be ignored. And population decline does not fully address sustainability concerns – as standard of living improves with the help of technology, the per-capita environmental footprint of the population also increases [O’Neill et al., 2018]. Technology must be offered that is inclusive of the world’s physical, cultural, and economic diversity, and which is manufactured, used, and recycled with environmental sustainability at the forefront. We hope to inspire our architecture community to take broader and more holistic approaches when developing technologies which include a deeper understanding of the biological, societal, cultural, environmental, political, and economic implications of future technological innovations. To summarize: 

- Build resilient, secure infrastructures – software, hardware, and everything in-between – for the computing spectrum of systems at all sizes and scales. 

- Design for the entire system life cycle from manufacturing to end-of-life and for the entire software development cycle from experimentation to deployment. Build environmentally-sustainable systems, software, and algorithms – beyond energy efficiency. 

- Broaden the scope of technologies to serve people from different parts of the world and with differing needs by enabling equitable access to technology and the rich economic opportunities it presents.

Socio-Technological Challenges and Opportunities: Paths Forward 

A PREPRINT 

For the next decades to come, we envision significant cross-disciplinary efforts to build a circular development cycle by placing _pervasive connectivity_ , _sustainability_ , and _demographic inclusion_ at the design forefront in order to sustain and expand the benefits of a technologically rich society.
