## **Abstract** 

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results, but their increasing resource demand has become a major obstacle to the development of powerful and accessible super-human intelligence. This report introduces JetMoE-8B, a new LLM trained with less than $0.1 million, using 1.25T tokens from carefully mixed open-source corpora and 30,000 H100 GPU hours. Despite its low cost, the JetMoE-8B demonstrates impressive performance, with JetMoE-8B outperforming the Llama2-7B model and JetMoE-8B-Chat surpassing the Llama2-13B-Chat model. These results suggest that LLM training can be much more cost-effective than generally thought. JetMoE-8B is based on an efficient Sparsely-gated Mixtureof-Experts (SMoE) architecture, composed of attention and feedforward experts. Both layers are sparsely activated, allowing JetMoE-8B to have 8B parameters while only activating 2B for each input token, reducing inference computation by about 70% compared to Llama2-7B. Moreover, JetMoE-8B is highly open and academia-friendly, using only public datasets and training code. All training parameters and data mixtures have been detailed in this report to facilitate future efforts in the development of open foundation models. This transparency aims to encourage collaboration and further advancements in the field of accessible and efficient LLMs. The models are publicly available at `https://github.com/myshell-ai/JetMoE` . 

## **1 Introduction** 

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results, but their increasing resource demand has become a major obstacle to developing powerful and accessible AI. Although modern LLMs have surpassed human performance on some tasks, they remain inefficient and inflexible. Most LLMs (e.g., Llama, Touvron et al. 2023; Pythia, Biderman et al. 2023; GPT-3, Brown et al. 2020; Mistral, Jiang et al. 2023) use all of their parameters during inference and training, which are referred to as dense models. Considering the substantial costs, the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture (Yuksel et al., 2012; Shazeer et al., 2017; Du et al., 2022; Pan et al., 2024) has emerged as a popular solution, enabling parameter scaling while keeping computational costs modest. Recent applications of MoE architectures in Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have yielded successful attempts at scaling language models to a substantial size, accompanied by remarkable performance, such as Deepseek MoE (Dai et al., 2024), Mixtral 8x7B (Jiang et al., 2024), Grok-1 (xai-org, 2024), and DBRX (Databricks, 2024). However, even though these models achieve excellent performance, they are not truly open-sourced as the training recipes are not published and may contain proprietary datasets inaccessible outside of large corporations. The open-source community has also attempted to train MoE models, such as OpenMoE (Xue et al., 2024), but its performance is only on par with weak dense models with similar activation parameters, such as OpenLLaMA (Geng & Liu, 2023) and TinyLLaMA (Zhang et al., 2024a).

![Figure](assets/figure_0001_page_0002.svg)Figure 1: JetMoE architecture 

To facilitate future efforts on open foundation models, particularly MoE models, we introduce JetMoE-8B, an innovative MoE architecture inspired by ModuleFormer (Shen et al., 2023) that extends the concept of sparse activation to both the attention and feed-forward layers. Unlike prior works that only apply sparse activation to the feed-forward layer, JetMoE-8B leverages sparse activation in both components to further reduce computational costs while maintaining performance. 

Impressively, JetMoE-8B is trained with a limited $100k budget, using 1.25T tokens from mixed open-source datasets and 30,000 H100 GPU hours. Despite its low cost, JetMoE-8B outperforms the Llama2-7B model, and JetMoE-8B-Chat outperforms the Llama2-13B-Chat model, demonstrating that LLM training can be much more cost-effective than generally thought. In addition, JetMoE-8B has 8B parameters while only activating 2B for each input token, reducing inference computation by about 70% compared to Llama2-7B. 

The key advantages of JetMoE-8B include: 

- **Openness and academia-friendly** : JetMoE-8B is trained using only public datasets and open-source training code, making it accessible to many academia research settings. The model can also be finetuned with limited compute budgets (e.g., consumer-grade GPUs). 

- **Sparse activation on both attention and feed-forward layers** , which significantly reduces training and inference costs. We also propose to share the kv projection in attention experts to improve training stability. 

- **Comprehensive open-source data mixture** , which ensures high-quality training using only open-source datasets. 

These innovations in JetMoE-8B pave the way for more accessible and efficient LLMs, benefiting the broader AI research community. To foster collaboration and further advancements, we have detailed all the training parameters and data mixture in this report. 

## **2 Model Architecture** 

- 2.1 Mixture of Experts 

A Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer comprises _N_ modules _f_ 1, . . . , _fN_ and a router _g_ ( _e |_ **x** ). Given an input **x** to the MoE layer, the router predicts a probability distribution over the _N_ 

2 



<u>JetMoE</u> 

modules. Of these, we select the top _k_ experts. When _k < N_ , we are using a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE, Shazeer et al. 2017). In this JetMoE, we use a linear layer to model the router 



$$
s = Wrtrx, (1)
$$



$$
g(e | x) = � softmax (Topk (s))i , si \in{}{}Topk (s) 0, si /\in{}{}Topk (s) (2)
$$

where **W** _rtr_ is the expert embedding matrix of shape ( _N_ , _D_ emb), Top _k_ is the operator that select the top _k_ logits from **s** . The final output of the SMoE is then given by 



$$
y = N \sum{}{} e=1 g(e | x) \cdot{}{} fe(x) (3)
$$

When _g_ ( _e |_ **x** ) = 0, _fe_ ( **x** ) will not need to be evaluated, thus reducing computation cost during training and inference. 

Following the design in ModuleFormer (Shen et al., 2023), JetMoE replaces both selfattention and Feed-forward layers (FFD) with SMoE layer. This is different from most opensource MoE models (Dai et al., 2024; Xue et al., 2024), that only replace FFD layers. 

### 2.2 FeedFoward Expert 

Each FFD expert is a standard 2-layer MLP with hidden state size _D_ ffd: 



$$
fmlp(x) = Woutσ (Winx) (4)
$$

Where **W** _out_ is the output projection matrix of shape ( _Demb_ , _D f f d_ ), **W** _in_ in the input projection matrix of shape (2 _D f f d_ , _Demb_ ), _σ_ is the SwiGLU activation function. 

### 2.3 Attention Expert 

Zhang et al. (2022) propose the Mixture of Attention heads (MoA), which extends SMOEs to attention mechanisms. We adapt MoA for our purposes, generalizing it to allow for multiple heads per expert and introducing RoPE relative positioning into the attention computation. 

In JetMoE, each attention expert _e_ is composed of four **R**<sup>_Demb×Datt_</sup> matrix: **W**<sup>_e_</sup> _q_<sup>,</sup><sup>**W**</sup> _k_<sup>,</sup><sup>**W**</sup><sup>_v_,</sup><sup>**W**</sup> _o_<sup>_e_,</sup> where _Datt_ = _H × Dhead_ , _H_ is the number of attention head inside each attention experts, _Dhead_ is the dimension of each attention head. Among these matrices, **W**<sup>_e_</sup> _q_<sup>and</sup><sup>**W**</sup> _o_<sup>_e_are</sup> owned by each expert, but **W** _k_ and **W** _v_ are shared across experts to improve the training and inference efficiency. 

Given an input vector sequence **x** , we first projected it to key vectors **k** and value vectors **v** using the shared key and value projection matrices: 



$$
k = Wkx (5)
$$



$$
v = Wvx (6)
$$

Inside expert _e_ , we project **x** into the query vectors **q** _e_ , apply standard multi-head attention with RoPE (Su et al., 2024), and project the attention output back to the input space: 



$$
qe = We qx (7)
$$



$$
ae = MHA (qe, k, v) (8)
$$



$$
oe = We oa (9)
$$

By introducing the MoA, we can scale up the attention layer with more attention experts while maintaining the same amount of computation. Such that the attention layer will not become a performance bottleneck, while we scale up the MLP layers.

### 2.4 Load Balancing during Pretraining 

To avoid the SMoE repeatedly using the same module and wasting the extra capacity in the other modules, it requires various load balancing losses to regulate the training of the router (Shazeer et al., 2017; Fedus et al., 2021). In the training of JetMoE, we use the frequency-based auxiliary loss introduced in Fedus et al. (2021) 



$$
lossb = N N \sum{}{} i=1 fiPi (10)
$$

where _N_ is the number of experts, _fi_ is the fraction of tokens dispatched to expert i, and _Pi_ is the fraction of the router probability allocated for expert _i_ . To improve the training stability, we also use the router z-loss introduced in Zoph et al. (2022): 



$$
lossz = 1 B B \sum{}{} i=1 � log N \sum{}{} j=1 exp(xi j) �2 (11)
$$

where _B_ is the number of tokens, _x_ is the logits given by router. The final training loss will be the weighted sum of three losses: 



$$
loss = losslm + αlossb + βlossz (12)
$$

where _α_ is the weight for load balancing loss and _β_ is the weight for z-loss.

## **4 Model Pretraining** 

### 4.1 Infrastructures 

We use Megatron (Shoeybi et al., 2019) as the training framework and integrate Megablock (Gale et al., 2023) for MoE support. We further modified the training framework to support MoA (Section 2.3) and z-loss (Section 2.4). Against the common practice, we choose the Pipeline parallelism introduced in (Narayanan et al., 2021) instead of the expert parallelism for model parallel during training. This is mainly due to two reasons. First, Sparse MoE models usually have a narrower hidden state compared to standard transformer models. Thus, the communication cost for pipeline parallelism is smaller. Second, we use the dropless MoE schema introduced in Gale et al. (2023); Shen et al. (2023), which could cause load unbalance across experts. Thus, using expert parallel will cause an unbalanced load across devices and result in inefficient training. Pipeline parallelism could avoid this slowdown because it computes all the experts inside a layer on the same device. We conduct training on a cluster containing 12 nodes and 96 H100s. Inside each node, gpus are connected via NVLinks. Infiniband is used for fast communication between nodes. 

### 4.2 Hyper-parameters 

|_Ptotal_|_Pactive_|_nlayers_|_Dmodel_|_Nexperts_|Top-_k_|_nkv_<br>_heads_|_Dhead_|_Dmlp_|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|8B|2B|24|2048|8|2|16|128|5632|



Table 1: JetMoE-8B hyperparameters. 

The hyperparameters of JetMoE-8B are selected based on the common practice for the 1B transformer language model. We replace all self-attention and MLP layers in the transformer with MoA and MoE. Then, we set the same number of experts to 8 and top- _k_ to 2 for every layer. Such that the model has approximately two times the computation compared to a 1B model. Following ST-MoE (Zoph et al., 2022), the weight for load balancing loss and z-loss is set to 0.01 and 0.001, respectively. Table 1 shows the key hyperparameters in JetMoE-8B. 

JetMoE-8B is trained with the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) with a maximum learning rate of 5e-4 and a batch size of 4M tokens with sequence length of 4096. We employ the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate schedule introduced in Hu et al. (2024). This learning rate scheduler is divided into three stages: the warmup stage (denoted by W, representing the number of steps at the end of the warmup stage), the stable training stage (denoted by S), and the annealing stage (denoted by D): 



$$
lr(s) =    s W ∗η, s < W η, W < s < S f (s -S) ∗η, S < s < S + D (13)
$$

where 0 _< f_ ( _s − S_ ) _≤_ 1 is a decreasing function of _s_ , and _η_ is the maximum learning rate. In our settings, the warmup stage lasts for 10 billion tokens, and the decay stage spans 250 billion tokens. The initial and final learning rates are set to 10% of the maximum learning rate. A weight decay of 0.1 and gradient clipping of 1.0 are applied during training. 

### 4.3 Training Data Mixture 

JetMoE-8B is trained on 1.25T tokens of primarily English data from web documents, mathematics, and code. Similar to the approach advocated in miniCPM (Hu et al., 2024) and Gemma (Team et al., 2024), we increase the weight of high-quality data during the learning rate decay phase. The training process is divided into two phases: 

- **Phase 1** (warmup and stable learning rate): The dataset includes RefinedWeb, Starcoder, The Pile, peS2o from Dolma, and OpenWebMath. 

6 



<u>JetMoE</u> 

- **Phase 2** (decay learning rate): We include additional high-quality data to further improve the model’s performance. 

The detailed data mixture can be found in Figure 2 and Table 2. It is important to note that given the limited computing budget available, our data mixture might not be ideal. However, it serves as a good starting point for training JetMoE-8B and can be further optimized in future iterations.

## **5 Model Alignment** 

- 5.1 Distilled Supervised Fine-Tuning (dSFT) 

The dSFT process involves training a student language model for replying to user prompts, with data generated by a teacher model (such as GPT-4 or Claude) (Wang et al., 2022; Taori et al., 2023; Chiang et al., 2023; Tunstall et al., 2023b). The key steps are as follows: 

7 



<u>JetMoE</u> 

1. **Data Distillation** : For a set of seed prompts _{x_<sup>0</sup> _j_<sup>_}_</sup> _j_<sup>_J_</sup> =1<sup>, generate responses</sup><sup>_y_0</sup> _j_<sup>using the</sup> teacher model _πT_ , and refine instructions to obtain _C_ = _{_ ( _xj_ , _yj_ ) _}j_<sup>_J_</sup> =1<sup>.</sup> 

2. **Instruction Tuning** : The student model _π_ dSFT is trained by maximizing the likelihood of the responses given the instructions: 



$$
πdSFT = arg max π \sum{}{} (x,y)\in{}{}C log π(y|x). (14)
$$

Note that the expectation for the likelihood function is approximated by using the arithmetic mean over a batch of training samples. 

### 5.2 Distilled Direct Preference Optimization (dDPO) 

dDPO refines the dSFT model by incorporating preferences from an aligned teacher model into the training process. It optimizes a reward function that reflects these preferences, aiming to align the student model’s outputs with the desired outcomes based on the static preference dataset. 

1. **KL-Constrained Optimization** : The foundation of dDPO lies in the KL-constrained optimization, which derives the optimal policy _πr_<sup>_∗_that maximizes expected rewards</sup> while minimizing divergence from a baseline policy _π_ 0 (Wang et al., 2023a): 



$$
π∗ r (y|x) := arg max π Ex∼d0 � Ey∼π(\cdot{}{}|x)[r(x, y)] -ηKL(π(\cdot{}{}|x)∥π0(\cdot{}{}|x)) � (15)
$$

   - where _η_ is a regularization parameter that balances maximizing the reward function _r_ ( _x_ , _y_ ) and adhering to the baseline policy _π_ 0. 

2. **Preference-Driven Reward Function** : dDPO incorporates a reward function that reflects preferences from an aligned teacher model: 



$$
r∗(x, y) = η log � π∗(y|x) πdSFT(y|x) � + η log Z(x), (16)
$$

quantifying the preference for producing response _y_ given input _x_ relative to the dSFT model’s baseline probability. _η_ scales the reward’s influence, and _Z_ ( _x_ ) ensures normalization. 

3. **Optimization Objective** : The objective for aligning _πθ_ with the teacher model’s preferences is: 



$$
πθ = arg max π \sum{}{} (x,yw,yl)\in{}{}D log σ � η log π(yw|x) πdSFT(yw|x) -η log π(yl|x) πdSFT(yl|x) � , (17)
$$

where _D_ comprises instruction-response pairs, with _yw_ and _yl_ indicating preferred and less preferred responses respectively, scored by the teacher model. 

Offline DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023) directly optimizes language model policies using static preference data, providing stable learning and simpler tuning compared to Reinforcement learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022; Christiano et al., 2023). However, it faces challenges with distribution shifts between the dataset and the evolving policy. Online and iterative DPO variants address this issue at the cost of increased computational complexity (Xu et al., 2023b; Guo et al., 2024b; Xiong et al., 2024). 

### 5.3 Alignment details 

Our alginment framework is based on Alignment Handbook (Tunstall et al., 2023a) using Pytorch 2 (He & Yu, 2023; Ansel et al., 2024) with DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 (Rajbhandari et al., 2020). We finetune the JetMoE-8B base model using dSFT on a combination of the following datasets: UltraChat 200k (Ding et al., 2023; Tunstall et al., 2023b), Airoboros-3.2 (Durbin, 

8 



<u>JetMoE</u> 

2023), Code-Feedback (Zheng et al., 2024b), Orca-math-word-problems-200k (Mitra et al., 2024), SystemChat (abacusai, 2024), and Capybara (Daniele & Suphavadeeprasit, 2023). Chat template is the same as Zephyr-7b-beta. The key hyperparameters for dSFT are a learning rate of 2e-5 with an Adam optimizer, a batch size of 128, and 3 epochs. 

We further finetune the JetMoE-8B-SFT model using dDPO on the UltraFeedback dataset (Cui et al., 2023), which contains binary preference labels indicating the preferred response between two options. The key hyperparameters for dDPO are a learning rate of 5e-7 with AdamW, a batch size of 128, and 1 epoch. This fine-tuning process results in the JetMoE-8B-Chat model. The entire alignment process takes 60 H100 GPU hours.

Table 3: OpenLLM leaderboard and code benchmarks results from four different models. 

We measure JetMoE-8B’s performance on tasks included in OpenLLM leaderboard<sup>2</sup> and from other domains, including physical reasoning (Bisk et al., 2020), social reasoning (Sap et al., 2019), question answering (Clark et al., 2019; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), mathematics (Cobbe et al., 2021), commonsense reasoning (Sakaguchi et al., 2021), language modeling (Paperno et al., 2016), reading comprehension (Joshi et al., 2017), and more. For most benchmarks, we use the same evaluation methodology as in the OpenLLM leaderboard to be comparable to other models.. We compare JetMoE-8B models to several external open-source (OSS) LLMs, including Gemma, LLaMA2, DeepseekMoE. 

In addition, we include HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) to evaluate the code generation of the models. Utilizing the BigCode Evaluation Harness (Ben Allal et al., 2022), we follow recent work on Code LLMs (Roziere et al., 2024; Guo` et al., 2024a) with greedy decoding, and report the mean pass@1 (mean success rate) for the two benchmarks. 

Table 3 shows the OpenLLM leaderboard and code benchmarks results from four different models. JetMoE-8B outperforms Gemma, LLaMA2, and DeepseekMoE on the OpenLLM leaderboard, achieving the best scores in all tasks except ARC-challenge and WinoGrande. Additionally, JetMoE-8B obtains the highest MBPP scores in Python programming. 

We also evaluated our model on MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023) with a strong LLM judge (gpt-4-0613 checkpoint). The temperature configuration, following the official FastChat implementation, is defined as follows: ”Writing” and ”Roleplay” tasks have a temperature of 0.7, indicating higher creativity; ”Extraction”, ”Math”, ”Coding”, and ”Reasoning” tasks

have a temperature of 0.0, suggesting preciseness; and ”STEM” and ”Humanities” have a temperature of 0.1, implying slightly more variability than 0.0 tasks. 

JetMoE-8B-Chat achieves a higher MT-Bench score than Llama-2-13b-Chat after alignment, demonstrating its superior performance. However, as shown in Figure 3, JetMoE-8B-chat is relatively weak in coding and extraction compared to GPT-3.5-turbo. This might be due to the smaller model size leading to suboptimal reasoning capability in these tasks. Despite this limitation, JetMoE-8B-chat exhibits strong performance across various other dimensions, making it a competitive model in the open-source LLM landscape. 

## **7 Limitation and Future Works** 

Due to the limited $100k budget, we can not afford any ablation study for the model architecture. The hyperparameters and data mixtures are also handpicked based on the empirical results from previous works (Shen et al., 2023; Zoph et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2024). In the future, it would be interesting to further study the actual contribution of different components to the final results. 

## **8 Conclusion** 

We introduce JetMoE-8B, an open-source MoE model that achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models while maintaining high efficiency. By leveraging sparse

<u>JetMoE</u> 

activation in both the attention and feed-forward layers, JetMoE-8B reduces computational costs while maintaining strong performance across a wide range of tasks. 

Trained using a two-phase approach and a carefully curated mixture of open-source datasets, JetMoE-8B outperforms larger and more resource-intensive models on the OpenLLM Leaderboard. In addition, JetMoE-8B-Chat demonstrates competitive performance compared to other open-source chatbots. 

We provide detailed training parameters and data mixture information to encourage reproducibility and enable researchers to build upon our work. JetMoE-8B represents a significant step forward in the development of open-source, efficient, and high-performing language models, contributing to the democratization of advanced language technologies. 

## **Acknowledgments** 

We express our gratitude to Shengding Hu for his valuable advice on the Phase 2 data mixture. We also express our gratitude to Exabits for their assistance in setting up the GPU clusters, and to Lepton AI for their support in setting up the chat demo.
